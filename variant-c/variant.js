Add another section with image below "How it works"

**Reasoning:**
The user wants to add another section with an image below the "How it works" section. I should update the variant code to add a new section that comes after the "How it Works" section.

Let me think about what would be a good section to add - something that complements the "How it Works" flow. It could be something like:
- A feature showcase with an image
- A benefits section with an image
- A visual demo or product image

I'll add a section that showcases the Ramp platform with an image and some descriptive text. I should place it right after the "How it Works" section.

I'll use fastEditVariantCode to add this new section. I need to:
1. Find where the "How it Works" section is being inserted
2. Add another section after it with an image and descriptive content

Let me create a compelling section that visually shows Ramp in action.

Now let me apply this to verify it works:

Perfect! âœ… The image section has been successfully added.

**What's new:**
- A **"Powerful Finance Platform"** section now appears below the "How It Works" section
- Two-column layout:
  - **Left side:** Compelling headline and descriptive text highlighting Ramp's capabilities, plus an "Explore Features" button
  - **Right side:** Visual image placeholder with a dashboard icon and description
- Responsive design that stacks on mobile
- Light gray background to distinguish it from the white "How It Works" section
- The section flows naturally from the three-step guide to showcase the actual platform

Your page now has the hero, a three-step process guide, and a feature showcase section all flowing together!

// Create the image showcase section
const imageShowcaseSection = (

// Insert the image section after the how it works section
howItWorksSection.insertAdjacentElement('afterend', imageShowcaseSection);

// Emit success event
window.CFQ = window.CFQ || [];
window.CFQ.push({ emit: 'variantRendered' });
} else {
console.error('Hero section not found');
}
